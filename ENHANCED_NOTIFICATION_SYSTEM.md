# Enhanced Notification System - DaysLeft v1.2.1

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to the DaysLeft app's notification system to provide better background execution and multiple reminder intervals.

## Problem Statement Addressed
1. **Notification alerting**: Enhanced to show clear event names with days left
2. **Background execution**: Improved to run reliably in background
3. **Multiple reminder intervals**: Added automatic 1-day and 3-day reminders

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Background Execution Improvements

#### Permissions Added
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Reschedule notifications after device restart
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - Schedule precise notification times
- `USE_EXACT_ALARM` - Use exact alarm scheduling for reliability

#### WorkManager Constraints
Enhanced all background workers with optimal constraints:
```kotlin
.setConstraints(
    Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.NOT_REQUIRED)
        .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(false)
        .setRequiresCharging(false)
        .setRequiresDeviceIdle(false)
        .build()
)
```

#### Boot Completed Receiver
Created `BootCompletedReceiver` to automatically reschedule all notifications when device restarts.

### 2. Multiple Reminder System

#### Automatic Reminders
Now schedules up to 3 reminders per event:
1. **User Preference** - Based on user's selected reminder offset (1, 3, or 7 days)
2. **1-Day Before** - Automatic reminder 1 day before event (if different from user preference)
3. **3-Day Before** - Automatic reminder 3 days before event (if different from user preference)

#### Smart Scheduling
- Prevents duplicate notifications if user preference matches automatic intervals
- Only schedules reminders that are in the future
- Each reminder has unique notification ID to prevent conflicts

### 3. Enhanced Notification Content

#### Rich Formatting
- Added emojis for better visual recognition:
  - üìÖ for regular events
  - ‚≠ê for important events
  - üö® for today's events
  - ‚è∞ for tomorrow's events
  - üìå for upcoming events

#### Clear Information Display
```
Title: "üìÖ Event Tomorrow!"
Content: "‚è∞ Important Meeting is TOMORROW (Dec 25, 2024)"
```

#### Notification Types
- `user_preference` - User's selected reminder time
- `automatic_1day` - Automatic 1-day reminder
- `automatic_3day` - Automatic 3-day reminder
- `important_daily` - Daily reminders for important events

### 4. Notification Channels Enhanced

#### Upcoming Events Channel
- Priority: HIGH (for better visibility)
- Vibration: Enabled
- Lights: Enabled
- Lock screen visibility: PUBLIC
- Badge: Enabled

#### Smart Priority System
- Important events: HIGH priority with enhanced vibration
- Events today/tomorrow: HIGH priority
- Regular future events: DEFAULT priority

### 5. System Integration

#### Application Startup
- Automatically reschedules daily digest and auto-archiving
- Notification channels created on app launch
- Permission handling integrated

#### Event Management
- Reminders automatically scheduled when events are added/updated
- Reminders cancelled when events are deleted or disabled
- Reschedule function available for permission changes

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions and boot receiver
2. `NotificationScheduler.kt` - Enhanced with multiple reminder logic
3. `EventReminderWorker.kt` - Improved notification content and validation
4. `NotificationChannels.kt` - Enhanced channel configuration
5. `EventViewModel.kt` - Added reschedule functionality
6. `MainActivity.kt` - Enhanced notification setup

### Files Added
1. `BootCompletedReceiver.kt` - Handles device restart scenarios
2. `NotificationSchedulingTest.kt` - Unit tests for notification logic

## Usage Examples

### User Creates Event
1. User creates "Doctor Appointment" for next week with 3-day reminder preference
2. System schedules:
   - 3-day reminder (user preference)
   - 1-day automatic reminder
   - No 3-day automatic (would be duplicate)

### Important Event
1. User marks "Job Interview" as important with 1-day reminder
2. System schedules:
   - 1-day reminder (user preference)
   - 3-day automatic reminder
   - Daily reminders until event date

### Device Restart
1. User restarts phone
2. `BootCompletedReceiver` automatically:
   - Reschedules daily digest
   - Reschedules auto-archiving
   - Background tasks continue working

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created `NotificationSchedulingTest.kt` to verify:
- Multiple reminder interval calculations
- Event validation logic
- Notification content formatting

### Manual Testing Required
Due to build environment limitations, these features require device testing:
- Background notification delivery
- Boot receiver functionality
- WorkManager constraint behavior
- Notification channel behavior

## Future Enhancements
1. Custom notification sounds per event
2. Snooze functionality
3. Location-based reminders
4. Integration with calendar apps
5. Backup/restore notification preferences

## Compatibility
- **Minimum SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: 36 (Latest Android)
- **Background execution**: Optimized for Android 12+ restrictions
- **Notification channels**: Full support for Android 8.0+

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working
1. Check notification permissions granted
2. Verify app is not in battery optimization whitelist
3. Check notification channels are enabled
4. Restart app to reschedule reminders

### After Device Restart
- Notifications automatically reschedule via `BootCompletedReceiver`
- If issues persist, open app once to trigger manual reschedule

This enhanced notification system provides reliable, comprehensive reminder functionality while maintaining battery efficiency and user control.
