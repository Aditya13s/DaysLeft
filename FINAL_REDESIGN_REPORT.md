# DaysLeft App - Complete UI Redesign

## Summary

I have successfully implemented a complete UI redesign for the DaysLeft app that addresses all the requirements specified in the problem statement. The new design is "good and simple", doesn't show past events prominently on the main screen, and provides a minimal, clean design that is accessible and useful.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ **Simplified and Clean Interface**
- Removed cluttered dashboard cards that showed counts for Today/Later/Past events
- Eliminated always-visible filter chips that added visual noise
- Created a clean, focused main screen showing only upcoming events
- Implemented a simple header with title and menu button for navigation

### ✅ **Past Events De-emphasized**
- Changed default view to show only upcoming events (today and future)
- Past events are no longer prominently displayed on the main screen
- Added menu system to access past events when needed, keeping them secondary
- Maintains the ability to view past events without making them the focus

### ✅ **Minimal and Accessible Design**
- Streamlined event cards with better visual hierarchy
- Simplified action buttons with consistent styling
- Enhanced accessibility with proper content descriptions
- Optimized touch targets for better usability
- Cleaner typography and spacing throughout

### ✅ **Smart Default Behavior**
- App now opens to "Upcoming Events" view by default
- Shows today's events and future events without past clutter
- Users can immediately see what's coming up and plan accordingly
- Past events are accessible but don't interfere with forward-looking planning

## Technical Implementation

### **New Filter System**
- Added `UPCOMING_ONLY` filter option for the new default view
- Updated ViewModel to use this filter by default
- Modified repository to support the new filtering logic
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing filters

### **Layout Redesign**

- **Event Cards**: Cleaner design with better information hierarchy
- **Navigation**: Menu-based system for accessing different views
- **Responsive**: Updated both portrait and landscape layouts

### **Code Quality**
- Maintained clean architecture principles
- Enhanced accessibility throughout the app
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added comprehensive documentation

The changes are minimal yet impactful, maintaining the app's core functionality while dramatically improving the user experience. Users can now focus on what matters most - their upcoming events - without being distracted by past events or overwhelming interface elements.
