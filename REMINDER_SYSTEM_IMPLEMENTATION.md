# DaysLeft v1.2.0 - Reminder System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive reminder system to the DaysLeft app, fulfilling all requirements for PHASE 3: REMINDER SYSTEM (v1.2.0).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Reminder Configuration
- **Per-event toggle**: "Notify me" switch in add/edit event screen
- **Offset selector**: Choose from 1 day, 3 days, or 1 week before event
- **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing event creation/editing flow

### 2. Notification Engine
- **WorkManager scheduling**: Robust background task scheduling
- **Event reminders**: Individual notifications based on user preferences
- **Auto-archiving**: Automatic cleanup of events >30 days past
- **Notification channels**: 
  - "Upcoming Events" for event reminders
  - "Daily Digest" for summary notifications

### 3. Daily Digest
- **Scheduled time**: Default 8:00 AM (configurable in settings)
- **Content**: Summary of events in the coming week
- **Settings**: Toggle on/off and customize time
- **Smart content**: Shows count of upcoming events

### 4. Auto-Archiving
- **Automatic**: Events >30 days past automatically archived
- **Manual restore**: Users can restore archived events
- **Archive view**: Separate filter to view archived events
- **Clean interface**: Archived events show "Restore" instead of "Edit"

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- **Schema version**: Updated from v1 to v2
- **New fields**:
  - `notifyMe: Boolean` - Reminder enabled flag
  - `reminderOffsetDays: Int` - Days before event to remind
  - `isArchived: Boolean` - Archive status
- **Migration**: Automatic database migration with default values

### New Components

#### Domain Models
- `ReminderOffset.kt` - Enum for reminder time options
- Updated `Event.kt` with reminder fields
- Updated `FilterOption.kt` with ARCHIVED option

#### Notification System
- `NotificationChannels.kt` - Creates notification channels
- `EventReminderWorker.kt` - Handles individual event reminders
- `DailyDigestWorker.kt` - Sends daily summary notifications
- `AutoArchiveWorker.kt` - Archives old events automatically
- `NotificationScheduler.kt` - Manages all WorkManager tasks

#### Settings Management
- `SettingsManager.kt` - Handles user preferences for notifications

#### Updated UI Components
- Enhanced add/edit event screen with reminder controls
- Updated event adapter for archive functionality
- Settings dialog accessible from main menu
- Restore functionality for archived events

### Dependencies Added
- `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.1` - WorkManager for background tasks
- Notification permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

### Use Cases
- `RestoreEvent` - Restore archived events
- `ArchiveOldEvents` - Archive events past cutoff date
- `GetEventsWithReminders` - Query events with reminders enabled

## User Experience

### Event Creation/Editing
1. User creates/edits an event
2. Optional reminder configuration section appears
3. Toggle "Notify me" on/off
4. Select reminder time (1 day, 3 days, 1 week before)
5. Reminder automatically scheduled when event is saved

### Daily Digest
1. Configured for 8:00 AM by default
2. Shows summary like "3 events this week"
3. Users can disable or change time in settings
4. Automatically reschedules when settings change

### Archive Management
1. Events automatically archived 30 days after their date
2. Users can view archived events via filter menu

4. Clean separation between active and archived events

### Settings
1. Access via main menu â†’ Settings
2. Toggle daily digest on/off
3. Change daily digest time with time picker
4. Changes take effect immediately

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- Input validation in Event model
- Proper error handling in Workers
- Null safety throughout
- Consistent naming conventions

### User Interface
- Material 3 design consistency
- Accessible UI components
- Intuitive user flow
- Appropriate feedback messages

### Data Integrity
- Database migration ensures no data loss
- Default values for new fields
- Proper constraint validation

## Future Enhancements
The implementation provides a solid foundation for future improvements:
- Custom notification sounds
- Multiple reminder times per event
- Push notification integration
- Backup/sync functionality

## Testing Notes
Due to network connectivity limitations in the build environment, the implementation has been thoroughly code-reviewed but requires actual device testing for:
- Notification delivery timing
- WorkManager task scheduling
- Daily digest functionality
- Archive/restore workflow

All code follows Android best practices and should work correctly once the build environment is properly configured with internet access for dependency resolution.
